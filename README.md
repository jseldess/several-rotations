# SEVERAL ROTATIONS

SEVERAL ROTATIONS is a book of poems by Jesse Seldess. This repository contains
the code used for various parts of the book:

- The `cli` directory contains the command-line utility used to generate the
starting points for the poems IF and ELSE and to generate the poem
2019-04-06-11:05:32 UTC (unmodified and named for its generation time), based on
the remnants of the process of writing the poem IN.
- The `flask` directory contains the Flask web app version, which is the
the last poem of the book.

See the `README.md` files in those directories for more details.
