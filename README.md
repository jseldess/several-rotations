# SEVERAL ROTATIONS

[SEVERAL ROTATIONS](https://www.kenningeditions.com/shop/several-rotations/) is a book of poems by Jesse Seldess. This repository contains
the code used for various parts of the book:

- The `cli` directory contains the command-line utility used to generate the
starting points for the poems IF and ELSE and to generate the poem
2019-04-06-11:05:32 UTC (unmodified and named for its generation time), based on
the remnants of the process of writing the poem IN.
- The `flask` directory contains the Flask web app version, which is the
the last poem of the book, OUT, at [https://several-rotations.org](https://several-rotations.org).

See the `README.md` files in those directories for more details.
