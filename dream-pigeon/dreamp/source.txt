I am trying to create interfaces that are hard to document because they have no consistent structure or behaviour and are not really distinct in any case.

In short, this is an inconsistent book in the face of persuasion and manufactured desires. Also, it was written at the scale of minutes stretched across much distance and time.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

I told her a story, she drew waves.

I care about your face, and I am trying to create interfaces that are hard to document because they have no consistent structure or behaviour and are not really distinct in any case.

In short, this is a logically inconsistent book – but not to confuse or distract you – in the face of constant persuasion and manufactured habits. Also, it was written at the scale of minutes stretched across much distance and time.

In short, this is a logically inconsistent book. But not to confuse or distract you. It is an intervention in the face of constant persuasion and manufactured habits. Also, it was written at the scale of minutes stretched across much distance and time.

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

No!

In short, this is a very logically inconsistent book. But not to confuse or distract you. It is an intervention. Also, it was written at the scale of minutes stretched across much distance and time.

or because I need this particular intervention, and might argue that you could use it, too, in the face of constant persuading and baiting, I don’t know. Both, I guess.

On the one hand, I enjoy documenting well-formed interfaces. But not for humans. But of course any interface created by humans is at least indirectly for humans. So why do I really like them?

In short, this is a very logically inconsistent book. But not to confuse you or distract you. Instead, I see it as a particular intervention that I need, and might argue that you could use it, too, in the face of constant persuading.

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions,

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation.
Between a face and an interface. Between exhaustion and saturation. Between work and life. And endless pairings of course for the sake of wrapping my head at any given moment.

Thin lines. Between a face and an interface. Between exhaustion and saturation. Between work and life. And endless pairings of course only for the sake of wrapping my head at any given moment.

The trackers on users

More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds
By NATASHA SINGER
The number of trackers collecting data on users' activities on the most popular Web sites in the United States has significantly increased in the last five months, according to research from the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology at the University of California, Berkeley.
The Berkeley project, called the "Web Privacy Census," aims to measure online privacy by conducting periodic web crawls and comparing the number of cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
During a test conducted on Oct. , researchers encountered cookies on every site included in a list of the  most popular sites compiled by Quantcast, an analytics and audience targeting firm.
On those  sites, researchers found , standard cookies last month compared with , cookies in May. In both months, third party trackers, not the Web sites themselves, set a majority of those cookies, the report said.
In October and May, cookies placed by DoubleClick, Google's ad technology service, appeared on the most sites on the top  list. ScorecardResearch, an analytics unit of comScore, was the second-most-prevalent tracker, the researchers reported.
The number of cookies on the top , and , Web sites also increased significantly, researchers said.
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
The Berkeley study comes at a time of fierce debate among federal regulators, advertising associations and consumer advocates over how best to regulate online tracking. Marketers advocate self-regulation, allowing consumers who wish to opt out of receiving ads based on data-mining to use an already-established industry program. Some consumer advocates are pushing for federal regulation as well as a "Do Not Track" mechanism that would allow Internet users to control tracking through settings on their own computer browsers.
Chris Hoofnagle, the director of information privacy programs at the Berkeley center and co-author of the study, said he hoped the data would set a baseline, providing all sides in the debate with empirical information as to the optimum method to regulate tracking.
"I'm hoping that it will inform which approach is the best," Mr. Hoofnagle said. "We are not going to be well-served unless we measure these trends more rigorously."
